              <h3>Currency</h3>
              <p>
                Our website automatically selects the currency that matches your
                delivery location. You can change this manually in the top left
                hand corner of the page.
              </p>

                For deliveries to the UK, we will bill you in Pounds Sterling
                (£), to the European Union in Euros (€), to the US in Dollars
                ($), and to the Rest of World in Pounds Sterling (£).

              <p>
                Given our high levels of security, it’s very unlikely fraudulent
                use of your card will take place on our website. But if a
                fraudulent transaction does take place, first contact your
                credit or debit card company so they can protect your card and
                reimburse you. Then let us know at customerservice@example.com
                and we will work with your card company to minimise any further
                inconvenience to you.
